Dear Sales-i

The following project contains my submitted code for the requirements specified within your github page
(https://github.com/sales-i/android-coding-test).

I just wanted to affirm and let you know that I implemented as many of the requirements as I could
within the two hour time limit, unfortunately  I couldn't implement them all.

I didn't get a chance to implement tasks iV and V.

If I did have enough time I would have done the following:

*Implement and injected the RuntimePermissions class
*Added the necessary permissions within the manifest
*Checked that the device running the app could make phone calls and had an network connection
*Check if they had permission granted, and if not request them.
*Store the granted permission within the onActivityResult callback

Looking forward to hearing from you.

James
